### Philosohophy of **Bootstrap 4** Design in Summary

- Components should be responsive and mobile-first
- Components should be built with a base class and extended via modifier classes
- Component states should obey a common z-index scale
- Whenever possible, prefer a HTML and CSS implementation over JavaScript
- Whenever possible, use utilities over custom styles
- Whenever possible, avoid enforcing strict HTML requirements (children selectors)
