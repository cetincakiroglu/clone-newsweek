# [Newsweek.com](https://www.newsweek.com) (2019-05 Clone) Project

An odin project that use Bootstrap4 to clone newsweek.com page in April 2019.

## Notes

- I tried use as little css as possible to maximize the usages of **Bootstrap 4**.
- This web page resopond to 3 different sizes screen (mobile, Table and Computer ).
- I use **Bootstrap 4** grid system to help make the website responsive, but still need to utilize some **media query** for hide and show some element.
- I use little Javascript to enable the scroll animation feature.

## Personal Takeaway

- I learn a lot **Bootstrap 4** framework through this project, **Bootstrap 4** can help frontend developer decorate their website more effectively, I can use very little css (just about 100 line for custom css style, you can see inside the code) but still manage to build this project without any trouble, I actually think I can use zero css if I knew bootstrap 4 good enough.

- However, I also find many limitations of **Bootstrap 4**, such as **grid system**, sizing, text,border, color etcs. So if you really want a very customizable web style, I don't suggest to use bootstrap.

* later I might want to learn more how to customize **Bootstrap 4** so I can really build my own framework on top of it.

### Philosohophy of **Bootstrap 4** Design in Summary

- Components should be responsive and mobile-first
- Components should be built with a base class and extended via modifier classes
- Component states should obey a common z-index scale
- Whenever possible, prefer a HTML and CSS implementation over JavaScript
- Whenever possible, use utilities over custom styles
- Whenever possible, avoid enforcing strict HTML requirements (children selectors)
